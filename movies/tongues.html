      Does a movie’s language or country of release impact its box office success? Is a movie in multiple languages more
      likely to reach a wider audience and bring in bigger numbers? In the movie Tongues, you will explore how language,
      release country and multilingual movies connect to box office success. </p>

    <h3>Setting the Scene</h3>

    <p> Before directly analysing the influence of the country and the language
      on
      the box office revenue, it is important to get an idea of the country and
      language distribution in the dataset. Let’s start by looking at the 10
      most common countries out of the 105 total. </p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/tongues/top_10_movie_release_countries.html" width="100%"
        height="100%" style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      The chart clearly shows that English-speaking countries dominate the list
      of top movie release countries. The United States of America leads with more
      than 7’500 released movies, which is almost seven times more than the
      second-highest release country, the United Kingdom. The remaining
      countries,
      such as France, Germany, and Canada show considerably lower numbers of
      movies. There is a strong presence of North America, Europe, parts of
      Asia and Australia, while South America and Africa are notably absent. </p>

    <p> What about the movie languages? Do the results align with the release
      country analysis? Let’s look at the 10 most common movie languages out of
      the 158 total. </p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/tongues/top_10_movie_languages.html" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p> The chart shows that English strongly dominates as the language for
      movies,
      with more than 8’000 titles. It surpasses all other languages by far.
      French, Spanish, and German follow but with significantly fewer movies.
      The
      other top languages, such as Italian, Korean, Japanese, Russian, Mandarin and
      Hindi show even smaller contributions to the total. </p>

    <p> This pattern aligns with the earlier analysis of release countries, where
      English-speaking nations, particularly the United States, led the way. The
      dominance of English reflects its global reach and influence in the movie
      industry. Other languages may have a more localised but still notable
      presence. </p>

    <h3> Language and Revenue: Uncovering the Connection </h3>

    <p> Do the languages of a movie influence its box office success? Language
      can
      determine how far a film can travel and who it can reach. Let’s look at
      the
      top 10 languages with the highest mean box office revenues. Languages with
      fewer than 50 movies are excluded as their mean box office revenue may not
      be representative. </p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/tongues/language_highest_mean_box_office.html" width="100%"
        height="100%" style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p> The chart reveals some unexpected results. Latin, Arabic and Russian languages lead in terms of average box
      office revenue, with $260M, $160M, and $150M respectively. This dominance is likely influenced by the relatively
      small number of movies in these languages. Latin has only 54 movies and Arabic just 94. When a few movies achieve
      exceptionally high box office success, they significantly raise the average. </p>

    <p> More common languages like English have far more movies, which dilutes their average revenue. For example,
      languages such as French with 640 movies and Spanish with 494 movies show lower averages at $110M and $130M,
      respectively. Their average box office revenue is spread across a larger number of movies. </p>

    <p> This highlights the impact of sample size. Languages with fewer movies are more sensitive to outliers, whereas
      languages with many movies tend to have more stable but often lower averages. The results show that while some
      languages dominate in terms of average box office revenue, this is often resulting from a few very successful
      movies rather than consistent performance across all movies.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h3> Language and Revenue: Trends Over Time </h3>

    <p> Since average box office revenues might be influenced by specific events or particular movies, let’s take a
      closer look at how they change year by year for the most common languages. </p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/tongues/average_revenue_per_language_per_year.html" width="100%"
        height="100%" style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p> The plot shows the average box office revenue per year for the 15 most common languages. It is immediately clear
      that English appears frequently, reflecting the large number of movies produced. However, its yearly average box
      office revenues are never particularly high. On the other hand, languages like Latin have a few years with very
      high average revenues, which significantly increase their overall average. This is because they have relatively
      few movies in total. </p>

    <p> For instance, in 1965, 1967, and 1968 Russian has particularly high average revenues. This is due to the success
      of four major movies: <i>War and Peace</i>, <i>Doctor Zhivago</i>, <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> and <i>You Only
        Live Twice</i>. Latin reaches its peak in 1972 and 1973, together with Arabic, due to the two movies <i>The
        Exorcist</i> and <i>The Godfather</i>. In 2006, thanks to the success of <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>, Latin again
      shows a noticeably high average. It is important to note that some languages may benefit disproportionately from
      successful movies where they are featured alongside other languages. For example, <i>The Da Vinci Code</i> has
      English as its primary language but includes some Latin parts. Equal importance is given to both languages.
      Because Latin has very few movies overall, this single success significantly increases its average box office
      revenue. For English on the other hand, such success has a much smaller impact due to the large number of movies
      in the dataset. </p>

    <p> The analysis highlights that languages with fewer movies are more sensitive to the influence of individual
      blockbuster hits, while languages with more movies tend to show more stable but less extreme averages. </p>

    <p> A linear regression and ANOVA analysis exploring the general relationship between language and box office
      revenue have shown that, even though the model does not explain much of the variance due to its low R-squared
      value, the p-value for several languages is significantly low and the ANOVA p-value is very low as well.
      Therefore, it can be concluded that language plays a statistically significant role, even though it is not
      sufficient on its own as a factor. </p>

    <hr>

    <h3> Multilingual Movies and Revenue: Exploring the Impact </h3>

    <p> Do movies with more than one language attract a wider audience and, in turn, generate higher box office
      revenues? Let’s explore whether multilingual films have an advantage when it comes to financial success. </p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/tongues/revenue_per_nbr_languages.html" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p> The plot shows the distribution of box office revenue in logarithmic scale based on the number of languages
      present in the movies. The median revenue increases as the number of languages rises, particularly from 1 to 6
      languages. Multilingual movies likely perform better financially because they can reach broader audiences. Even if
      a movie contains only a few words of a certain language, it can still have an impact on native speakers and make
      the movie more appealing to them. </p>

    <p> For movies with 7 or more languages, the observed trend becomes less consistent. There are very few movies in
      these categories, which may explain the lack of a clear pattern or further increases. No movies in the dataset
      feature exactly 10 languages, confirming the limited representation at higher numbers. </p>

    <p> Overall, the general trend highlights that multilinguality can have a positive influence on box office revenue.
    </p>

    <h3> Revenues on the Map: Exploring Global Patterns </h3>

    <p> Let’s take a look at how average box office revenues are distributed across the globe. Are there regions that
      dominate financially and are there others that remain underrepresented? </p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/tongues/map_average_revenue_by_country.html" width="100%"
        height="100%" style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p> The map displays the average box office revenue by country and reveals some patterns and gaps in the global
      representation. Africa, for example, has large regions with missing data. </p>

    <p> Some countries, like Kenya and Thailand, exhibit very high average box office revenues. However, this is likely
      due to the small number of movies produced in these regions, where a few successful movies significantly increase
      the average. Such results should be interpreted with caution, as they may not reflect a consistent trend but
      rather the impact of individual blockbusters. </p>

    <p> In contrast, the United States of America has a high average box office revenue that is more reliable and
      representative. This is because the USA produces a large volume of movies and its average revenue is less
      influenced by outliers. The consistency of American box office success reflects its dominant role in the global
      movie industry. </p>

    <h3> Release Country and Revenue: Revealing the Impact </h3>

    <p> How does the release country influence box office revenue? Are there specific countries that dominate the global
      movie market? Let’s explore which countries lead in driving box office success and determine if their impact is
      statistically significant. </p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/tongues/country_highest_mean_box_office.html" width="100%"
        height="100%" style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p> The United States of America leads by far with an average box office revenue of $93M, based on a substantial
      volume of 7’226 movies. This makes the USA's average more reliable and reflective of consistent success and proves
      its dominance in global cinema. </p>

    <p> The United Kingdom follows with an average of $62M, though with significantly fewer movies. This suggests that
      while fewer movies are produced, many perform well. Spain, in third place, achieves an average box office revenue
      of $53M, but with even less movies. The high average is therefore probably due to some specifically successful
      movies. </p>

    <p> Countries like France and Japan maintain notable averages and their values are likely stabilised by a larger
      number of movies. On the other hand, countries like Hong Kong and Australia show moderate averages but their
      smaller movie counts make them more sensitive to the influence of individual blockbusters. </p>

    <p> In terms of continental presence, North America stands out with both the USA and Canada represented even though
      their average revenues differ significantly. Europe is well-represented with the United Kingdom, Spain and France
      among the top countries and Asia also has a notable presence with Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong. Australia is
      as well included among the top countries. However, Africa and South America are absent, further highlighting the
      differences in representation across global markets. </p>

    <p> A linear regression and ANOVA analysis exploring the general relationship between release country and box office
      revenue have shown results similar to those for the language relationship. The linear model does not explain much
      of the variability in the data, so the fit is not particularly strong. However, several countries show low
      p-values, indicating that their influence on box office revenue is statistically significant. </p>

    <p> The influence is positive for all countries except Canada, which has a negative coefficient of -0.4670. This
      means that having Canada as the release country might decrease the chances of achieving high box office revenues
      for a movie. The highest positive coefficient is for the USA, with a value of 0.7361, indicating that releasing a
      movie in the USA can have a significant positive impact on its box office revenue. </p>


    <p> The p-value of the ANOVA analysis is very low, meaning the null hypothesis that box office revenue means are the
      same for all countries can be rejected. There is statistically significant evidence that the release country has
      an impact on box office revenue. </p>

    <hr>


    <h3> The Final Scene: Bringing It All Together </h3>

    <p> So, after all the analysis, what can be concluded? </p>

    <p> After looking at all the plots and considering the statistical analysis, some takeaways can be drawn: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> The movie market is overwhelmingly dominated by the English language and, more specifically, the United
        States as the release country. </li>
      <li> Both language and release country have a statistically significant impact on a movie’s box office revenue.
      </li>
      <li> Averages for languages with fewer movies can be heavily influenced by a few highly successful movies and
        often benefit from being featured alongside more common languages. </li>
      <li> North America, Europe, parts of Asia and Australia are well represented as release countries in the movie
        market. However, South America and Africa are notably underrepresented in the dataset. </li>
    </ul>

    <p> In conclusion, the language and release country of a movie do influence its box office revenue. However, the
      analysis also highlights that focusing exclusively on these aspects provides only a limited understanding of the
      many complex factors driving box office success. </p>
