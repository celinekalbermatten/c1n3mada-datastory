      The movie <b>Shades</b> aims to provide an understanding of whether certain genres are associated with higher revenues and
      how the relationship between genre and revenue evolves over time. By examining trends, correlations, and revenue
      distributions, we uncover key insights into the dynamics of movie genres and their box office success. </p>

    <h3> Setting the scene </h3>

    <p>
      Let's explore the relevant aspects of our dataset. In this analysis, we will focus on attributes like the list of
      genres and the release year of the movies. There are <b>316</b> unique genres in the dataset. The top 20 most
      common
      genres are shown in the plot below and include <i>Drama</i>, <i>Comedy</i>, <i>Adventure</i>, <i>Romance Film</i>,
      <i>Action</i>, <i>Thriller</i>, and
      others. Interestingly, <b>97.24%</b> of movies (<b>9243</b> out of <b>9505</b>) have at least one genre from the
      top 20 most common
      ones.
    </p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/shades/number_of_movies_per_genre.html" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p> As you might have already guessed, the movies in our dataset are often categorized under multiple genres.
      However, what is the percentage of movies that have more than one genre? How does the distribution of the number
      of genres per movie look like? Let's take a closer look.</p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/shades/number_of_genres_per_movie.html" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      The chart above shows that multi-genre movies are very common in our dataset. In fact, <b>94.19%</b> of the movies
      have
      more than one genre. The majority of movies are assigned between 3 and 6 genres, with the highest counts observed
      for movies with 4 and
      5 genres. We notice a steady decrease in the number of movies with more than 6 genres, indicating that it is
      uncommon for a movie to be categorized into a very high number of genres, for example 10 or more.

    <h3> Genre and Box Office Revenue: Exploring the connection</h3>

    <p>How does the genre impact the box office success of a movie? Our goal is to uncover if certain themes are
      linked with higher earnings. We will explore the top 20 genres with the highest average box office revenues.
    </p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/shades/interactive_top_20_genres_with_highest_revenue.html"
        width="100%" height="100%" style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      The chart above lists <i>Space Opera</i>, <i>Demonic Child</i>, and <i>Roadshow Theatrical Release</i> as the
      highest-earning movie genres on average. This finding is unusual because none of the top 20 highest-earning genres
      are among the top 20 most common genres in the dataset. By hovering over the bars in the interactive plot, you can
      view the number of movies associated with each genre.
      For instance, <i>Space Opera</i> and <i>Demonic Child</i> each have just 5 movies, while genres like
      <i>Coming-of-Age Film</i> and <i>Archeology</i> have only 1. So, what’s going on here?
    </p>
    <p></p>
    Many of these high-revenue genres, such as <i>Space Opera</i> and <i>Demonic Child</i>, have very few movies in the
    dataset. Hence, their high average revenues are likely driven by outliers. For example,
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Space Opera</i> includes <b>Star Wars</b>. (Yes, <b>Star Wars</b>, the saga that made
        <i>“May the Force be with you”</i> a cultural phenomenon and turned galaxies far, far away into box office
        gold.)
      </li>
      <li><i>Demonic Child</i> includes <b>The Exorcist</b>, the terrifying classic that still sends chills down spines.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Given the multi-genre nature of our dataset, these movies are likely listed under other, more common genres whose
      average revenues are lower. For instance,
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Star Wars</b> is also classified under <i>Fantasy</i>, <i>Action</i>, <i>Science Fiction</i>, and
        <i>Adventure</i>.
      </li>
      <li><b>The Exorcist</b> is also categorized under <i>Horror</i> and <i>Drama</i>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To better understand revenue trends, the analysis will now focus on the top 20 most common genres, which, as noted
      earlier, account for <b>97.24%</b> of the movies in the dataset. Let us take a look.
    </p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/shades/interactive_top_20_genres_with_highest_revenue_2.html"
        width="100%" height="100%" style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p> As explained before, we show the average box office revenue for the top 20 most common genres in our dataset. We
      observe that <i>Fantasy</i> and <i>Family Film</i> genres have the highest average revenues, exceeding
      <b>$175M</b>. <i>Science
        Fiction</i>, <i>Adventure</i> and <i>Action</i> also show a strong average revenue, possibly due to their
      popularity in
      big-budget blockbusters. On the other hand, genres such as <i>World Cinema</i> and <i>Indie</i> have much lower
      average
      revenues, below <b>$25M</b>.
    </p>

    <p>While the average box office revenue provides an insight, it does not fully capture the distribution of revenues
      across genres. The boxplots below will offer a more detailed view. </p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/shades/boxplots_revenue_distribution_top_20.html" width="100%"
        height="100%" style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p>The boxplots show the distribution of the <b>log-transformed revenues</b>, which stabilizes the variance and
      reduces
      the skewness caused by extreme values in the revenue data. The plots reveal that many genres exhibit wide revenue
      ranges with noticeable outliers, i.e., movies that earned significantly more or less than others in the same
      genre. </p>

    <p> To explain the influence of the top 20 genres on the box office revenue, we also built a linear regression
      model. The model explains <b>19.7%</b> of the variance in box office revenue (R-squared), indicating that genres
      alone are modest predictors of revenue. Genres with significant positive coefficients included <i>Fantasy</i>,
      <i>Family
        Film</i>, <i>Adventure</i>, <i>Musical</i>, <i>Action</i>, and <i>Thriller</i>, all showing strong associations
      with higher revenue. On
      the other hand, genres with significant negative coefficients included <i>Indie</i>, <i>World Cinema</i>, and
      <i>Crime
        Thriller</i>, showing weaker revenue associations.
    </p>

    <h3> Genre and Box Office Revenue: Trends over Time </h3>

    <p> We want to understand how the box office revenue trends for different genres evolved over time. Were there time
      periods when some genres were more profitable than others? Let's take a closer look.</p>

    <div class="plot-container-large">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/shades/revenue_trends_over_time_heatmap.html" width="100%"
        height="100%" style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p>The heatmap above shows the average box office revenue per genre over time, masking the years with no data. Clear
      trends are difficult to observe due to a few visible outliers that skew the distribution. Let’s explore this
      further.</p>
    <p>As stated before, revenue spikes are visible for genres like <i>Family Film</i>, <i>Fantasy</i>, and <i>Period
        Piece</i> in specific years, likely due to outliers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The revenue spikes in 1937 in <i>Family Film</i> and <i>Fantasy</i> are due to <b>Snow White and the Seven
          Dwarfs</b>.</li>
      <li>The revenue spike in 1939 in <i>Period Piece</i> is due to <b>Gone with the Wind</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It’s difficult to determine the most profitable genres over the years based on the previous visualization. What
      was the most profitable genre for each decade? Let’s find out.</p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/shades/genre_ranking_over_time_racing_barplot.html" width="100%"
        height="100%" style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p>This interactive chart visualizes the ranking of movie genres based on their average box office revenue per
      decade. The horizontal bars represent the average revenue for each genre, with longer bars indicating higher
      revenue. The timeline slider below allows you to explore changes in genre rankings over time. As you move the
      slider across decades (from 1910 to 2010), the chart will update to show how the profitability of genres has
      evolved.
    </p>

    <p>We can see that <i>Fantasy</i> and <i>Family Films</i> have consistently dominated since the 1930s, maintaining
      top
      rankings for multiple decades. <i>Science Fiction</i> gained significant relative success starting in the 1970s.
      <i>Indie</i> and <i>World Cinema</i> genres consistently ranked at the bottom, showing lower average box office
      revenue over
      time.
    </p>

    <p>A logical follow-up question arises: What is the relationship between the number of movies produced over the
      years and the average box office revenue
      per genre? We want to explore whether periods with higher box office revenues for genres are associated with
      increased production. Let’s find out.</p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/shades/grid.html" width="100%" height="100%" style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p>This interactive line chart visualizes the average box office revenue (in blue) and the number of movies produced
      (in red) for a selected genre over time. The horizontal axis represents the years, while the two vertical axes
      correspond to the respective metrics: average revenue (on the left, in dollars) and movie count (on the right).
    </p>

    <p>As we can observe, the period spanning the late 1970s and early 1980s appears to have been a period of
      particularly
      high average box office revenue across most genres. This suggests a potential "golden age" for certain types
      of films during that time. Furthermore, in more recent decades, we observe a distinct trend of increased
      production
      volume across many genres. While production has increased, it's important to remember that this doesn't
      automatically
      translate to consistently higher average revenues, as we've noted before (more isn't always more). To understand
      this relationship better, we can explore the correlation between the number of movies produced and the average box
      office revenue per genre. Let's have a look at the correlation plot below.
    </p>

    <div class="plot-container-large">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/shades/correlation_shades" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p>This bar chart shows the correlation coefficients between the number of movies produced in each genre and their
      average box office revenue over time. The Pearson correlation measures the strength of a linear relationship,
      while the Spearman correlation captures how well the relationship can be explained by ranked or monotonic trends.
    </p>

    <p>From the plot, genres like <i>Mystery</i>, <i>Science Fiction</i>, and <i>Action</i> show both positive Pearson
      and Spearman correlations with moderate strength, as for example Spearman values above 0.3. This suggests a meaningful
      relationship where producing more movies in these genres tends to increase average revenue.
      In contrast, genres like <i>Indie</i> films have both negative Pearson and Spearman correlations, with moderately
      strong
      values, for example Pearson around -0.36. This indicates a consistent decline in average revenue as more movies in this
      genre are produced.
    </p>

    <p>Several genres, such as <i>Fantasy</i>, <i>Crime Fiction</i>, and <i>Drama</i>, have a positive Spearman
      correlation but a
      negative Pearson correlation. The strength of these correlations is generally weak to moderate, with Spearman
      values slightly above 0 and Pearson values below 0. This mixed result indicates that while the relationship isn't
      strongly linear (negative Pearson), there is still a consistent ranking trend (positive Spearman)that may reflect
      more complex patterns, such as diminishing returns or varying movie success. </p>

    <h3> The Final Scene: Bringing It All Together </h3>

    <p> What did we discover from all this analysis? </p>
    <p> After checking out the plots and digging into the stats, here are the main things we’ve learned: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The top 20 most common genres, like <i>Drama</i>, <i>Comedy</i>, and <i>Adventure</i>, dominate the
        movie market, accounting for <b>97.24%</b> of all movies in the dataset.</li>
      <li>High-revenue genres, such as <i>Space Opera</i> and <i>Demonic Child</i>, achieve impressive average earnings
        but are outliers, with very few movies in these categories driving their success.</li>
      <li>Among the most common genres, <i>Fantasy</i>, <i>Family Film</i>, and <i>Science Fiction</i> stand out with
        the highest average box office revenues, often tied to large-scale, big-budget productions.</li>
      <li>Correlations reveal interesting trends: genres like <i>Mystery</i> and <i>Science Fiction</i> show positive
        relationships between movie production and revenue, while <i>Indie</i> films exhibit a negative correlation.
      </li>
