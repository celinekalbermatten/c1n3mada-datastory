      Movies light up our screens, but their success often depends on more than just the story. Is the idea of a summer
      blockbuster really supported by the data? And do longer movies tend to make more money during certain seasons? In
      the movie <b>Waves</b> you will get insights into the influence of a movie’s release time and season on its success and
      how runtime and <i>genre</i> contribute to it.

    <h3>Setting the Scene</h3>
    <p> Let’s first take a look at how a movie’s average box office revenue changes depending on the season.</p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/waves/season_revenue_bar.html" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p><i>Summer</i> emerges as the peak season. With an average box office revenue of over <b>$115M</b> it has the
      highest revenue among all seasons. <i>Spring</i> follows with slightly more than <b>$80M</b>, while <i>Fall</i>
      has almost <b>$70M</b>. <i>Winter</i>, with around <b>$60M</b>, is the least favourable season for box office
      success.</p>

    <h3>Season and Revenue: Exploring the Connections</h3>

    <p> How do box office revenues vary across the seasons? Let’s look at their distributions and identify the trends.
    </p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/waves/boxplot_season.html" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    The data shows distinct seasonal trends. <i>Summer</i> has the highest average values, reflecting consistent performance, 
    while <i>winter</i> exhibits the largest variance and the highest maximum, indicating significant variability. <i>Spring</i> and 
    <i>autumn</i> act as transitional periods, with steadier patterns leading into the extremes of <i>summer</i> and <i>winter</i>.

    <h3>Genre Matters: Exploring the Season-Genre Connection</h3>

    <p> Which <i>genres</i> were the most popular in different years? How has this popularity changed over time? To start the
      analysis of <i>genre</i> influence, let’s explore their trends in popularity over the years. </p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/waves/genre_popularity_over_time.html" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p><i>Drama</i> and <i>Comedy</i> maintain their dominance over decades, while genres like <i>Thriller</i> and <i>Romance</i> movies gain prominence 
      in the latter half of the 20th century. Over time, the overall number of movies produced has increased, but an interesting 
      spike can be observed around <b>1950</b>. This era was a turning point for the film industry as theaters faced growing competition 
      from the rise of television, which began pulling audiences away from cinemas. To counter this, studios ramped up production 
      and experimented with innovations like Technicolor, widescreen formats, and immersive sound to lure audiences back to theaters. 
      This revival strategy, coupled with the booming post-war economy and the public’s craving for entertainment, 
      led to an unprecedented surge in movie production, making <b>1950s</b> a standout period.</p>
    
    <p> What are the most common genres during each season of the year? Let’s explore the top genres for each season so
      those with the highest number of movie releases during a particular time of year. </p>
    
    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/waves/top_genres_by_movie_count_per_season.html" width="100%"
        height="100%" style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>
    
    <p> Looking at the top <b>5</b> genres by movie count, <i>Drama</i> leads in all seasons. However, during <i>Summer</i>, it’s time to
      shine for <i>Comedy</i>, which is almost overtaking <i>Drama</i> in popularity. The <i>Action</i> genre also has comparatively high
      popularity in <i>summer</i>. <i>Romance</i> takes a spot on the podium during <i>Winter</i>, a time when people enjoy the coziness of
      staying indoors, especially during the Valentine’s Day and Christmas holidays. <i>Thriller</i> and <i>Adventure</i> genres are
      also popular during <i>Summer</i>, while <i>Crime Fiction</i> and <i>Science Fiction</i> are more common in <i>Fall</i>. </p>
    
    <p> After looking at the seasonal leaderboards based on the number of movie releases, let’s now explore the relation
      between seasons and box office revenue across different genres. </p>
    
    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/waves/genre_season_heatmap.html" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>
    
    <p> <i>Summer</i> shows consistently high revenues across most genres. However, the highest averages are seen during
      <i>spring</i>, with <i>Fantasy</i>, <i>Adventure</i> and <i>Family Film</i> with values around <b>$200M</b>, <b>$190M</b> and <b>$170M</b>, respectively. These
      three <i>genres</i> perform well across all seasons but achieve their best results in <i>Spring</i> and <i>Summer</i>. <i>Thriller</i>, on the
      other hand, shows noticeable differences depending on the season, with its peak in <i>Summer</i> and a drop of around
      <b>$60M</b> in <i>Fall</i>. A similar trend is seen with <i>Crime Fiction</i>, which has its peaks in <i>Summer</i> and its lowest phase in
      <i>Winter</i>. This analysis highlights interesting differences in box office revenues when looking at how genre and
      season interact. </p>

    <h3>Runtime and Revenue: A Seasonal Perspective</h3>
    
    <p> Does runtime play a supporting role in the seasonal blockbuster phenomenon? Let's explore the relationship
      between runtime and revenue across different seasons. </p>
    
    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/waves/runtime_revenue_scatter.html" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>
    <p>What’s the perfect runtime for box office success? The data suggests it’s right around <b>120 minutes</b>—long enough 
      to tell a compelling story but short enough to keep audiences hooked without glancing at their watches. 
      Movies in this range consistently dominate the revenue charts, mea
      But what about the outliers? Short films under <b>80 minutes</b> and extra-long epics over <b>150 minutes</b> tend to generate 
      lower revenues on average. Shorter films might leave audiences feeling short-changed, while excessively long ones 
      risk losing their attention. Of course, there are always exceptions—movies with strong hype or cultural significance 
      can break the mold and deliver big earnings, regardless of runtime.
    
    <hr>
    
    <h3>Release Day: Exploring the Impact of Weekly Timing</h3>
    
    <p> Season isn’t the only timing factor. The release day of the week can influence the box office revenue too. Do
      movies released on Fridays or weekends tend to make more money on average? Let’s have a closer look at the daily
      box office averages. </p>
    
    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/waves/dayofweek_revenue.html" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>
    
    <p> Movies released on Wednesdays surprisingly generate the highest average revenues, a phenomenon that might be explained 
      by strategic timing around holidays or mid-week events. For instance, in the U.S., blockbusters are sometimes released 
      on Wednesdays ahead of major holidays like Thanksgiving or the Fourth of July, allowing studios to maximize revenue over 
      an extended weekend period. This pattern suggests a hypothetical theory: Wednesday releases benefit from being positioned 
      at the crossroads of mid-week momentum and extended leisure periods. Monday, Thursday, and Tuesday follow in revenue averages, 
      while weekend days, including Friday, show noticeably lower average box office revenues. </p>

    <h3>The Final Scene: Bringing It All Together</h3>
    
    <p> So, after all the analysis, what can be concluded? </p>
    
    
    Movies don’t just shine on the big screen—they sparkle in the right season. <i>Summer</i> reigns as blockbuster season, with <i>Action</i> and 
    <i>Comedy</i> raking in the big bucks. <i>Winter</i> is a wildcard, delivering the highest highs but also the wildest swings, indeed <i>Romance </i> movies
    are the most popular during this season due to Valentines Day and Christmas holidays. 
    Runtime is another star— <b>90-120 minutes</b> hits the sweet spot, long enough to grip but short enough to keep audiences glued. 
    Even the release day is important! Wednesday releases top the revenue charts, outshining traditional weekend openings, thanks to clever holiday timing.
    
    In the end, it’s all about strategy. A movie’s success is a mix of timing, runtime, and a little seasonal magic—proof that box office gold 
    is as much about planning as it is about storytelling.
