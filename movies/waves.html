      This film provides insights into the influence of a movie’s release time
      and
      season on its success, and it also examines
      how runtime and genre factor into the equation. Is that summer blockbuster
      formula actually backed by data?
      And do longer films have a better shot at high revenue in certain seasons?
      Let’s find out.
    </p>
    
    <hr>

    <h3>Are all seasons created equal?</h3>
    <p>We begin with a broad overview. The histogram below shows the
      distribution
      of movie revenues.
      As you hover over each bar, you can see the count of movies and the
      corresponding revenue range.</p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/waves/revenue_distribution.html" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p>Most movies cluster in the lower-revenue range, yet a handful of outliers
      achieve extraordinary earnings.
      But how is this distribution influenced by the season of release?</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Seasonal Patterns</h3>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/waves/season_revenue_bar.html" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p>Here, we observe that summer shows higher average revenues. Now let's see
      the genre popularity by season for the top 5 genres:</p>
    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/waves/top_genres_by_movie_count_per_season.html" width="100%"
        height="100%" style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>


    <p> It is seen that drama movies are the leader except for the summer reason
      where comedy takes the lead! Let's also observe the movie revenue
      distribution by season: </p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/waves/boxplot_season.html" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>


    <p>Again, we observe that summer is the dominating season in revenue.
      However,
      although there are outliers in all of the seasons, winter does not seem
      like
      the best time to release a movie. But does runtime also play a part in
      these
      seasonal success stories?</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Runtime vs. Revenue: A Seasonal Perspective</h3>
    <p>Let's explore the relationship between runtime and revenue across
      different
      seasons.
      Use the legend on the side to select a season and observe how the
      correlation is:</p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/waves/runtime_revenue_scatter.html" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p>In some seasons, longer films might earn more, while in others, runtime
      seems less important. For this plot, the general observation is the
      revenue
      increases with longer runtime, however it is not a strong relation.</p>

    <hr> 
    <h3>Genre Effects</h3>
    <p>Different genres may have seasonal sweet spots. Select a genre to observe
      how its average revenue shifts by season:</p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/waves/genre_season_heatmap.html" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p>As you hover over the cells/bars, you may discover that certain genres
      thrive in spring times,
      while others peak in fall or winter. The interplay of genre, season, and
      runtime shapes box office performance.</p>

    
    <hr>  
    <h3>Day-of-Week and Year Patterns</h3>
    <p>Season isn’t the only timing factor. Release day of the week can
      influence
      revenue too. Check out the chart below
      to see if movies released on Fridays or weekends tend to make more money
      on
      average:</p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/waves/dayofweek_revenue.html" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p>Notice any patterns? Best revenues were observed in movies released on
      Mondays and Wednesdays! But how about the release year?</p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/waves/genre_popularity_over_time.html" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p>Drama and Comedy appear as the most consistently popular genres,
      especially
      in recent decades. Genres like Action/Adventure and Romance Film gain
      prominence later, particularly in the latter half of the 20th century.</p>
