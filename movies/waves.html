      This film provides insights into the influence of a movie’s release time
      and
      season on its success, and it also examines
      how runtime and genre factor into the equation. Is that summer blockbuster
      formula actually backed by data?
      And do longer films have a better shot at high revenue in certain seasons?
      Let’s find out.
    </p>
    
    <hr>

    <h3>Setting the Scene</h3>
    <p>Movies light up our screens, but their success often depends on 
      factors beyond just content. Release timing and duration may be important 
      variables. From broad patterns to possible insights, we embark on the 
      exploration of seasonal trends, runtime effects, and the interplay of genres.</p>

    <h3>Are all seasons created equal?</h3>
    <p>Our story begins with a sweeping overview: a histogram revealing the distribution of movie revenues.
      As you hover over each bar, you can see the count of movies and the
      corresponding revenue range.</p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/waves/revenue_distribution.html" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p>Most movies cluster in the lower-revenue range, but a few 
      exceptional blockbusters soar far above the rest.
      But how is this distribution influenced by the season of release?</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Seasonal Patterns</h3>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/waves/season_revenue_bar.html" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p>Zooming in, we discover that summer emerges as the peak season, 
      with the highest average revenues. Seasons don’t just shape 
      the numbers, they shape audience preferences. Now let's see
      the genre popularity by season for the top 5 genres:</p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/waves/top_genres_by_movie_count_per_season.html" width="100%"
        height="100%" style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>


    <p> It is seen that drama, typically the most popular genre, 
      cedes its crown to comedy during this sunny stretch! Our exploration of 
      the top 5 genres by movie count shows that drama leads consistently 
      across most seasons. However, summer is the time for comedy to shine, 
      overtaking drama in popularity. Winter and fall, meanwhile, continue 
      to favor drama’s deeper narratives. Let's also observe the movie revenue
      distribution by season: </p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/waves/boxplot_season.html" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>


    <p>Again, we observe that summer is the dominating season in revenue.
      However,
      although there are outliers in all of the seasons, winter does not seem
      like
      the best time to release a movie. But does runtime also play a part in
      these
      seasonal success stories?</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Runtime vs. Revenue: A Seasonal Perspective</h3>
    <p>Does runtime play a supporting role in the seasonal blockbuster phenomenon?
      Let's explore the relationship between runtime and revenue across
      different
      seasons.
      Use the legend on the side to select a season and observe how the
      correlation is:</p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/waves/runtime_revenue_scatter.html" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p>In some seasons, longer films might earn more, while in others, runtime
      seems less important. For this plot, the general observation is the
      revenue
      increases with longer runtime, however it is not a strong relation.</p>

    <hr> 
    <h3>Genre Effects</h3>
    <p>Different genres may have seasonal sweet spots. Select a genre to observe
      how its average revenue shifts by season:</p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/waves/genre_season_heatmap.html" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p>As you hover over the cells/bars, you may discover that certain genres
      thrive in spring times,
      while others peak in fall or winter. The interplay of genre, season, and
      runtime shapes box office performance.</p>

    
    <hr>  
    <h3>Day-of-Week and Year Patterns</h3>
    <p>Season isn’t the only timing factor. Release day of the week can
      influence
      revenue too. Check out the chart below
      to see if movies released on Fridays or weekends tend to make more money
      on
      average:</p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/waves/dayofweek_revenue.html" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p>Notice any patterns? Movies released on Wednesdays and Mondays defy expectations, 
      generating the best average revenues. Friday and Saturday releases, though convenient, 
      show slightly lower averages. But how about the release year?</p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/waves/genre_popularity_over_time.html" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p>A heatmap of genre popularity over time reveals fascinating trends:
      Drama and comedy maintain their dominance over decades. Genres like Thriller and Romance Film gain
      prominence later, particularly in the latter half of the 20th century.</p>

    <h3>Final Scene</h3>
    <p> As the story unfolds, the interplay of season, genre, runtime, 
      and even day-of-week emerges as a key factor woven with data and patterns.
      Summer may reign as the box office king, but it’s not the only contender. 
      Genres like drama dominate in quieter seasons, while comedy brings 
      the heat during summer's peak. And although longer runtimes often 
      contribute to success, their influence depends on the timing and genre.

      Monday and Wednesday break expectations with higher revenues, proving 
      that timing matters down to the day. The historical heatmap reminds us that 
      cinema is constantly evolving. Drama and comedy have stood the test of time, 
      but action and romance are symbols of how cultural shifts influence what 
      captivates audiences.</p>
