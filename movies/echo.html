    <p> Ever wondered if a high IMDb rating truly translates into bigger box office bucks? Ratings often guide our
      viewing choices. A well-rated film draws us in, while a poorly rated one might push us away. But do higher scores
      actually mean more money? In the movie Echo, you will explore the connection between IMDb ratings and a movie’s
      financial success - digging into whether there’s more to it than just the number on the screen. </p>

    <h3> Setting the Scene </h3>

    <p> Before investigating the relationship between ratings and revenue, it's important to understand the dataset. The
      dataset
      includes a diverse range of movies, each categorized by genre, IMDb rating, and inflation-adjusted box office
      revenue. Let's start by exploring the genre distribution. What are the most prevalent genres? Different genres
      appeal to different audiences, which might influence how ratings affect financial success. </p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/echo/num_movies_per_genre.html" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p> The bar chart illustrates the number of movies per genre in the dataset. <i>Drama</i> emerges clearly as the
      most
      common genre, with over 4’200 movies. The second most common genre is <i>Comedy</i>, which has nearly 3’000
      movies.
      <i>Thriller</i> and <i>Romance Film</i> follow, with roughly 2’000 movies each. Genres like <i>Action</i>,
      <i>Crime Fiction</i> and <i>Adventure</i>
      are moderately represented, while categories such as <i>Romantic Comedy</i>, <i>Romantic Drama</i> and
      <i>Horror</i> have smaller
      counts, each under 1’000 movies. The least represented genres, including <i>Mystery</i>, <i>Fantasy</i> and
      <i>Science Fiction</i> have
      fewer than 700 entries. This distribution highlights <i>Drama</i>'s dominant presence, suggesting its broad appeal
      and
      versatility, whereas niche genres like <i>World Cinema</i> or <i>Fantasy</i> cater to more specific audiences.
      These disparities
      could influence how ratings impact financial success across genres.
    </p>

    <h3> Rating and Revenues: Taking a Closer Look </h3>

    <p> Let's take a closer look at the distribution of IMDb ratings to understand how movies are rated overall. </p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/echo/imdb_rating_distribution.html" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;"></iframe>
    </div>


    <p> The distribution of IMDb ratings shows a clear pattern. Most movies have ratings between 6 and 7, creating a
      noticeable peak. This indicates that most films receive moderate ratings. Ratings below 5 and above 8 are much
      less common, suggesting that movies rarely get very low or very high ratings, or fewer people rate them in such
      cases. </p>

    <p> The distribution of box office revenues is intriguing. Are movie earnings evenly spread out or do a few
      blockbusters dominate? </p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/echo/box_office_revenue_distribution.html" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p> The distribution of box office revenues shows a clear skew. Most movies cluster in a specific range with
      log-transformed revenues peaking around 7. This corresponds to moderate box office success and suggests that the
      majority of movies earn a relatively stable amount, neither flopping completely nor breaking records. </p>

    <p> However, the tail to the right indicates that a small number of movies achieve exceptionally high revenues
      and therefore skew the distribution. On the other hand, the left end of the curve shows a very small number of
      movies with extremely low earnings. This uneven spread highlights the disparity in box office success, where a few
      blockbusters dominate financially while most movies achieve more modest results. </p>

    <h3> Ratings Meet Revenues: Exploring the Connection </h3>

    <p> Now let's put it all together. On one side, we have IMDb ratings, and on the other, the log-transformed box
      office revenues. Does a higher rating always mean more earnings? Or is the relationship more complex? Let's find
      out. </p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/echo/imdb_rating_vs_box_office_revenue.html" width="100%"
        height="100%" style="border: none;"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p> The plot shows a scattered pattern, resembling distant stars rather than a tight cluster. There is a slight
      upward trend, indicating that higher IMDb ratings might help boost box office revenue, but they don't guarantee
      financial success. Even movies with similar ratings have varied revenues. This shows that many factors influence
      earnings beyond just audience or critic approval. </p>

    <hr>

    <h3> Genre: The Impact on the Rating-Revenue Connection </h3>

    <p> Do certain genres rely more on ratings to drive revenues? Let’s take a closer look at the correlation between
      ratings and revenue across different genres to find out. </p>

    <div class="plot-container-large">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/echo/genre_correlation.html" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p> The plot reveals that the relationship between IMDb ratings and box office revenue varies slightly across genres,
      but no genre shows a really strong connection. While some genres, such as <i>Period Piece</i> and <i>Film Adaptation</i>,
      exhibit slightly higher correlations with values around <b>0.3</b> to <b>0.4</b>, the values remain modest overall. This suggests that,
      regardless of genre, even if ratings play a role in revenue, they are not a decisive factor. The findings remain
      consistent: ratings can help but their impact is not dramatic and there are other factors influencing the
      box office success. </p>

    <hr>

    <h3> A New Character Enters: The Role of Votes in the Rating-Revenue Connection </h3>

    <p> What if the number of votes a movie receives actually matters more than the ratings themselves? Perhaps more
      popular movies reach a wider audience and therefore attract more people. Let’s analyse this in a 3D view that
      includes ratings, the number of votes and the box office revenue. </p>

    <div class="plot-container-large">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/echo/3d_regression_plane.html" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p> The 3D visualization reinforces a clear pattern: votes win the day. Movies with a higher number of votes tend to
      get more revenue, regardless of their IMDb rating. The surface trend shows that revenue primarily increases with
      the
      number of votes. Ratings clearly contribute less to the relationship. This suggests that the number of votes has a
      stronger influence on box office success than the quality represented by the ratings. Widespread audience
      attention
      seems to be more important for the revenue than high ratings alone. </p>

    <hr>

    <h3> Clearing the View: Density Map for Revealing Patterns in the Data </h3>

    <p> With thousands of points, it’s easy to get lost in the scatterplot noise. Let’s visualise the data using a
      density
      map that groups the points into bins, making patterns clearer. </p>

    <div class="plot-container-large">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/echo/hexbin_regression_plane.html" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p> The density map confirms the earlier findings: most movies cluster around mid-level ratings and moderate box
      office revenues. The colour gradient shows a concentration of movies in this range. The gentle slope of the
      regression confirms that the relationship between ratings and revenue is weak. </p>

    <hr>

    <h3> Measuring the Connection: Correlation Analysis </h3>

    <p> Are the links between rating, revenue and number of votes real or could they just be a coincidence? Let’s
      analyse them from a statistical point of view. Which factors are related and to what extent? </p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/echo/correlation_matrix.html" width="100%" height="100%"
        style="border: none;"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p> The correlation matrix shows how ratings, revenue and number of votes are connected. The strongest relationship
      is between the number of votes and the box office revenue with a moderate positive correlation of <b>0.50</b>. This means that
      movies earning more revenue tend to attract more audience votes. Ratings show weaker connections with a <b>0.36</b> correlation
      to votes and a very weak correlation of <b>0.19</b> to revenue. This indicates that higher ratings might slightly help
      increase the number of votes and the financial success but they are not major drivers. Overall, the matrix shows
      that while some relationships exist, other factors likely have a stronger influence on these outcomes. </p>

    <hr>

    <h3> The Final Scene: Bringing It All Together </h3>

    <p> So, after all the analysis, what can be concluded? </p>

    <p> After looking at all the plots, correlations, and regression lines, some takeaways can be drawn: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ratings and revenue are only slightly connected. A high IMDb rating doesn’t mean a movie will be a box office
        hit. There is a link but it’s weak.</li>
      <li>Genre also matters a little. For some genres, the connection between ratings and revenue is slightly stronger
        but overall, the genre doesn’t really change the story.</li>
      <li>The real star is popularity. When considering the number of votes a movie gets, it becomes clear that
        popularity
        has a much bigger role in box office success. Ratings themselves start to matter less.</li>
    </ul>

    <p> In the end, IMDb rating is like a supporting actor. They play a role but they are not the main driver of
      success.
      Popularity, measured by the number of votes, often takes the centre stage. So, the next time you pick a movie
      because of its rating, remember: it’s probably the movie’s popularity, not just that number, that’s bringing in
      the
      big bucks. </p>
