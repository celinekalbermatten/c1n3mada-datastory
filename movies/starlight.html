    <p>We often think of famous directors like <strong>Steven Spielberg</strong>, <strong>Quentin Tarantino</strong>, or
      <strong>Martin Scorsese</strong>. But how much does a director truly influence a movie's box office success? In
      the movie <em>Starlight</em>, we dive into the connection between directors and box office performance.
    </p>

    <h3>What is the role of a director?</h3>

    <p>A director's role is to bring a script to life. They oversee the creative aspects of a film, including its visual
      style, tone, and the performances of the actors. A director is the key driving force in a movie's production,
      making crucial decisions that shape the final product. But who are the directors behind the highest-grossing
      movies?</p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/starlight/log_max_box_office_revenue_over_time.html" width="100%"
        height="100%" style="border: none;">
      </iframe>
    </div>

    <p>Surprisingly, the leader here is <strong>Victor Fleming</strong> in 1939, who directed <em>Gone with the
        Wind</em>, one of the highest-grossing movies of all time. This may come as a surprise, as Fleming is less
      well-known than directors like <strong>Steven Spielberg</strong> or <strong>James Cameron</strong>. To explore
      further, let's examine some metrics that highlight a director's influence:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The total box office revenue of all movies directed by a director,</li>
      <li>The number of movies directed.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/starlight/top_15_directors_total_revenue.html" width="100%"
        height="100%" style="border: none;"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>As expected, <strong>Steven Spielberg</strong> tops the list of directors with the highest total box office
      revenue, followed by <strong>James Cameron</strong> and <strong>Peter Jackson</strong>. But does being a
      successful
      director also mean directing more movies? Let’s take a look at the number of movies directed by each filmmaker.
    </p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/starlight/top_15_directors_movie_count.html" width="100%"
        height="100%" style="border: none;"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>Here we again see many well-known directors, such as <strong>Steven Spielberg</strong>, <strong>Woody
        Allen</strong>, and <strong>Clint Eastwood</strong>, who have directed numerous films. However, these static
      views
      don't clearly show how consistent these directors are over time. To better visualize this, let’s let them race!
      Here
      is an animated race chart showing the top 15 directors by cumulative box office revenue over time.</p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/starlight/cumulative_revenue_director_top15_raceplot.html"
        width="100%" height="100%" style="border: none;"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>This race reveals how some directors, such as <strong>Spielberg</strong>, take the lead later in time and
      dominate
      for long periods. However, in this race we are more looking at the success of the directors instead of movie
      success. To get another perspective, let’s look at the top 15 movies each year using a treemap.</p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/starlight/slow_top_15_movie_revenue_by_director.html" width="100%"
        height="100%" style="border: none;"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>This visualization shows that, in every year or mostly at least, a single movie dominates the box office revenue.
      Furthermore, some directors manage to place multiple movies in the top 15, further showcasing their consistent
      success. Now, let’s extend this concept and view the top 15 directors over time in a treemap format.</p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/starlight/slow_top_15_movie_director_treemap_over_time.html"
        width="100%" height="100%" style="border: none;"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>This treemap reveals that once a director achieves significant success, they often remain at the top for long
      periods. While the leaders change over decades, successful directors maintain their influence for extended
      stretches
      of time.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>

    <p>Through these visualizations, we can see that directors do play an important role in a movie's box office
      performance. Successful directors not only achieve significant revenues but also maintain their dominance over
      time.
      However, it is important to note that while the director is a critical factor, other elements—such as cast,
      marketing, and story—also contribute to a movie's success.</p>
