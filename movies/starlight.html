    <p>Have you ever wondered if a director's name guarantees box office success? In the movie Starlight, you explore
      how a director can influence a movie's financial journey.</p>

    <h3>Setting the Scene</h3>

    <p>To understand the role of directors, it’s important to first explore the cinematic landscape. What is the maximum
      box office revenue achieved each year? Let’s take a closer look!</p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/starlight/log_max_box_office_revenue_over_time.html" width="100%"
        height="100%" style="border: none;"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>There are notable differences across the years. The highest box office revenues were achieved in 1937 and 1939
      with <b>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</b> by <i>William Cottrell</i> and <b>Gone with the Wind</b> by <i>Victor
        Fleming</i>, respectively.
      Other blockbusters include <b>Bambi</b> by <i>James Algar</i> in 1942 and <b>Alice in Wonderland</b> by <i>Clyde
        Geronimi</i> in 1951.

      More recent successes were achieved by <b>Titanic</b> by <i>James Cameron</i> in 1997 and <b>Avatar</b> by
      <i>James Cameron</i> in 2009. Over
      the years, directors such as <i>James Algar</i>, <i>Victor Fleming</i>, <i>Clyde Geronimi</i>, and <i>James
        Cameron</i> have had multiple
      standout hits, contributing significantly to box office revenues across different decades.</p>

    <h3>Directors in the Spotlight: Exploring the Total Revenue and Number of Movies</h3>

    <p>Who is on top of the leaderboard for total box office revenue in their lifetime? Is this success influenced by
      the number of movies they’ve directed? Producing more movies might boost the overall box office revenue but
      achieving success through a few blockbusters is also possible. Let’s first reveal the leading names in terms of
      total box office revenue.</p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/starlight/top_15_directors_total_revenue.html" width="100%"
        height="100%" style="border: none;"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p><i>Steven Spielberg</i>, the undisputed king of blockbusters, tops this chart. His classics like <b>Jurassic
        Park</b> and <b>E.T.</b>
      have attracted many audiences. <i>James Cameron</i> and <i>Peter Jackson</i> are also well-known names in the
      world of cinema.
      However, since they are all from an older generation, younger directors may catch up with them in the years to
      come.</p>

    <p>Let’s see if the number of movies directed plays a role. Do the leading names in terms of overall box office
      revenue also direct the most movies? </p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/starlight/top_15_directors_movie_count.html" width="100%"
        height="100%" style="border: none;"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>Although <i>Steven Spielberg</i> dominates the charts with the highest total box office revenue and <i>Woody
        Allen</i> leads in
      the sheer number of movies directed,
      these metrics alone don’t tell the full story.
      Success in the film industry often depends on consistency and timing rather than just quantity or cumulative
      revenue.
      For instance, directors may experience sudden spikes or periods of stagnation in their careers.
    <p>Alright, let’s spice things up! What if we could watch these directors race to the top over time? This dynamic
      leaderboard shows how careers rise and fall. Some directors might quickly gain fame while others probably take a
      slower, steady path to success. Who holds the lead in the 1980s? When does <i>James Cameron</i> enter the game?
      Does <i>Spielberg</i> maintain his reign? Let’s hit play and watch the action unfold as the top 15 directors
      battle it
      out for box office glory!</p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/starlight/cumulative_revenue_director_top15_raceplot.html"
        width="100%" height="100%" style="border: none;"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>
      Around 1935, there was a close competition between <i>Victor Fleming</i> and <i>William Cottrell</i>.
      <i>Cottrell</i> narrowly took the
      lead for the highest-grossing movie with <b>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</b>. However, <i>Victor Fleming</i>
      got victorious
      in the long run and maintained the lead over <i>Cottrell</i>. In 1942, <i>James Algar</i> made a dramatic entrance
      with <b>Bambi</b>,
      but despite the movie's success, he couldn't overtake the established leaders. <i>Clyde Geronimi</i> joined the
      competition shortly after. He steadily climbed the ranks and eventually took first place in 1959 by a considerable
      margin. This dominance persisted until the late 1970s when <i>Steven Spielberg</i> began his slow and steady
      ascent. It
      started with <b>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</b> in 1977.
      <i>Spielberg</i> overtook <i>James Algar</i>, <i>William Cottrell</i>, and <i>Victor Fleming</i> and claimed the
      top spot, which he has held
      to this day.
    </p>

    <p> Even if not on the overall leaderboard, some directors might have been very successful in specific years.
      Let’s have a look at the leading names over the years. The larger the space taken per director,
      the more outstanding his success was compared to the others.
    </p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/starlight/slow_top_15_movie_director_treemap_over_time.html"
        width="100%" height="100%" style="border: none;"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p> This animation gives a fascinating look at the shifting world of box office dominance. Many directors have their
      moment in the spotlight during a given year, but the bigger story is about staying in the game over time.
      <i>Steven
        Spielberg</i> isn’t always on top every single year. Sometimes another director comes along with a blockbuster
      that
      steals the show. But <i>Spielberg</i>’s strength lies in his consistency. Year after year, he delivers hit after
      hit.
      That’s how he stays ahead, showing that making multiple great movies over time is far more effective than relying
      on one big success.</p>

    <p>
      It’s interesting to see how the top directors often share the spotlight. It's rare for one person to completely
      dominate. This collaborative competition makes the
      race even more exciting. The animation shows that while having a standout year is great, the directors who stay
      active, keep creating, and adapt to changing trends are the ones who leave a mark.</p>

    <h3>Stars Directing Star Movies: Revealing the Blockbusters Behind the Directors</h3>

    <p>As already noted, directing even a few blockbusters can significantly boost a director's lifetime box office
      revenue.
      Let’s have a look at the top movies by revenue per year and explore how they have impacted the cinematic world
      over time.</p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/starlight/slow_top_15_movie_revenue_by_director.html" width="100%"
        height="100%" style="border: none;"></iframe>
    </div>
    <p>
      Intriguing trends in how directors have dominated box office revenues across the years are revealed. For instance,
      as previously mentioned, the 1930s saw monumental successes with <i>William Cottrell</i>’s <b>Snow White and the
        Seven Dwarfs</b> in 1937 and
      <i>Victor Fleming</i>’s <b>Gone with the Wind</b> in 1939. However, other significant moments, such as 1931's
      <b>Frankenstein</b> are noticed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moving into the 1940s, <b>Pinocchio</b> and <b>Fantasia</b> in 1940 were major contributors to the box office.
      There are also
      years where revenue was more evenly distributed among multiple movies and directors. Not all years are dominated
      by one or two blockbuster movies, enabling the contributions of
      multiple directors to shine. In some cases, directors managed to release multiple successful movies within a
      single year, such as <i>Mel Brooks</i> with <b>Blazing Saddles</b> and <b>Young Frankenstein</b> in 1974.
    </p>

    <!-- <p>
    Through this kind of visualization, it becomes evident how certain years have star movies that eclipse others, but also how shifts in audience 
    preferences and market conditions allowed for a more even distribution of success among directors in other years. It emphasizes that while some 
    directors like Clyde Geronimi and James Cameron repeatedly take large slices of the box office pie, others manage to make their mark through singular 
    blockbuster successes.</p> -->

    <h3>The Final Scene: Bringing It All Together</h3>

    <p> When looking back on the journey of directors and their influence on box office revenues, one thing is clear:
      while a director’s role is important, it’s just one piece of what makes a movie successful. A director’s vision
      and leadership shape the movie but other factors are just as crucial. </p>

    <!--- <p>As we reflect on the fascinating journey of directors and their impact on box office revenues, one thing is clear: the director’s role is pivotal, but it is far from the sole factor that determines a movie’s success. A director’s vision and leadership often set the tone for a film, guiding everything from the performances to the final cut, but other elements play equally significant roles. A compelling story, a star-studded cast, cutting-edge visual effects, and marketing that captivates the audience all contribute to a film’s box office triumph.
    This analysis has shown us the rise and fall of great directors over the decades, from William Cottrell and Victor Fleming’s dominance in the early cinematic era to the steady reign of Steven Spielberg, punctuated by monumental hits from James Cameron and others. Through visualizations like race plots and treemaps, we’ve seen how some directors, like Spielberg, play the long game with consistency and a portfolio of hits, while others shine brightly in specific moments with singular masterpieces.
    Yet, beyond the numbers and charts, Starlight reminds us that movies are more than just box office statistics—they are cultural touchstones, moments of connection, and stories that endure across generations. Directors shape these narratives, but it is the synergy of countless elements that makes a film a true success.
    So as the credits roll, we leave with one final thought: Is it the name in the director’s chair, or the perfect alignment of vision, artistry, and timing that creates box office magic? Perhaps the answer lies somewhere in between—where creativity meets opportunity, and where dreams are brought to life on the silver screen.</p> -->
