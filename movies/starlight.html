    <h3>Setting the Scene</h3>

    <p>To understand the role of directors, it’s important to first explore the cinematic landscape. What is the maximum box office revenue achieved each year? Let’s take a closer look!</p>

    </div>

    <h3>Directors in the Spotlight: Exploring the Total Revenue and Number of Movies</h3>

    <p>Who is on top of the leaderboard for total box office revenue in their lifetime? Is this success influenced by the number of movies they’ve directed? Producing more movies might boost the overall box office revenue but achieving success through a few blockbusters is also possible. Let’s first reveal the leading names in terms of total box office revenue.</p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/starlight/top_15_directors_total_revenue.html" width="100%" height="100%" style="border: none;"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>Steven Spielberg, the undisputed king of blockbusters, tops this chart. His classics like Jurassic Park and E.T. have attracted many audiences. James Cameron and Peter Jackson are also well-known names in the world of cinema. However, since they are all from an older generation, younger directors may catch up with them in the years to come.</p>

    <p>Let’s see if the number of movies directed plays a role. Do the leading names in terms of overall box office revenue also direct the most movies? </p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/starlight/top_15_directors_movie_count.html" width="100%" height="100%" style="border: none;"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p>Even though Steven Spielberg appears again on the top list, the number of movies alone does not seem to be a determining factor. The leaderboards for total box office revenue and the number of directed movies do not significantly overlap. In terms of quantity, Woody Allen leads with 36 directed movies, followed by Clint Eastwood with 28.</p>

    <p> The number of movies does not seem to directly influence overall success. Perhaps it’s about creating a niche? Or did the most successful directors achieve their success sequentially? Let’s take a look at how their revenues evolved over time. </p>

    <div class="plot-container">
      <iframe src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plots/starlight/cumulative_revenue_director_top15_raceplot.html" width="100%" height="100%" style="border: none;"></iframe>

    <p>A thrilling neck-and-neck competition between Spielberg and Cameron in the 2000s is noticed. TODOOOOO ANALYSE A BIT MORE, FIND SOME OTHER INTERESTING THINGS.</p>

    <p> Even if not on the overall leaderboard, some directors might have been very successful in specific years. Let’s have a look at the leading names over the years. The larger the space taken per director, the more outstanding his success was compared to the others. </p>

    <div class="plot-container">

    <h3>The Final Scene</h3>

    <p>TO DOOOOOOOO COMPLETE Directors undeniably play a pivotal role in a film's financial success, as evidenced by their sustained influence over time. Yet, they are only one part of a larger cinematic equation. Factors like storytelling, cast, and marketing also share the spotlight.</p>
